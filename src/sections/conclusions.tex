In this manuscript, we derived formula for sums of
powers~\eqref{theorem:multifold-sums-of-powers-via-backward-difference}
via Newton’s interpolation formula based on backward finite differences of powers.
In addition, we noticed that backward differences are closely related to Eulerian numbers, and Stirling numbers of the second kind.
Thus, we expressed formulas for sums of powers in terms of Eulerian numbers~\eqref{prop:multifold-sums-of-powers-in-eulerian-numbers},
and Stirling numbers of the second kind~\eqref{prop:multifold-sums-of-powers-in-stirling-numbers}.

Future research directions are discussed and proposed at~\cite{kolosov_2025_18102534}, which includes
development of generalized algorithm for sums of powers using interpolation formulas combined with
hockey-stick family identities for binomial coefficients.

All the results are validated using \texttt{Mathematica} programs, see section~\eqref{sec:mathematica-programs}.
