In this manuscript, we derived formula for sums of
powers~\eqref{theorem:multifold-sums-of-powers-via-backward-difference}
by utilizing Newton’s interpolation series for backward finite differences of powers.
In addition, we noticed that backward differences are closely related to Stirling numbers of the second kind, and Eulerian numbers.
Thus, we expressed formulas for sums of powers in terms of Stirling numbers of the second kind~\eqref{prop:multifold-sums-of-powers-in-stirling-numbers} 
and Eulerian numbers~\eqref{prop:multifold-sums-of-powers-in-eulerian-numbers}.

Future research directions are discussed and proposed at~\cite{kolosov_2025_18102534}, which includes
development of generalized algorithm for sums of powers using interpolation formulas combined with
hockey-stick family identities for binomial coefficients.

All the results are validated using \texttt{Mathematica} programs, see section~\eqref{sec:mathematica-programs}.
