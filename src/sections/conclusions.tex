In this manuscript, we derived formulas for multifold sums of
powers~\eqref{theorem:multifold-sums-of-powers-via-backward-difference},
by utilizing Newton's interpolation series in backward differences.
In addition, we highlight that backward differences of powers are closely
related to
Stirling numbers of the second kind $\stirlingii{n}{k}$,
and Eulerian numbers $\eulerian{m}{k}$.
Thus, we expressed  formulas for multifold sums of powers in terms of Stirling numbers
of the second kind~\eqref{prop:multifold-sums-of-powers-in-stirling-numbers}
and Eulerian numbers~\eqref{prop:multifold-sums-of-powers-in-eulerian-numbers}.
Future research directions are discussed and proposed
in~\cite{kolosov_2025_18102534}, which includes
development of generalized framework for sums of powers using interpolation
formulas combined with
hockey stick identities for binomial coefficients.
All the results are validated using \texttt{Mathematica}
programs; see Section~\eqref{sec:mathematica-programs}.
