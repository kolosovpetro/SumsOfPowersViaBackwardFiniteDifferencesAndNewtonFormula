We obtain formulas for sums of powers via Newton’s interpolation formula based on backward finite differences of powers.
In addition, we note that backward differences are closely related to Eulerian numbers, and Stirling numbers of the second kind.
Thus, we express formulas for sums of powers in terms of Eulerian numbers, and Stirling numbers of the second kind.
